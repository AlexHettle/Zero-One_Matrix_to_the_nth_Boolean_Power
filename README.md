# Zero-One_Matrix_to_the_nth_Boolean_Power
A program that takes in an integer from the user and uses that number to raise a randomly generated 5X5 zero-one matrix to the boolean power of the user's input
The boolean power of a matrix is when a zero-one matrix is raised to a certain power and then all numbers inside the matrix either remain as zero or are reduced down to one in order to maintain the trait of being a zero-one matrix.
